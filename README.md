# Yagi-Uda-Antenna

## Design, simulation, fabrication and measurement of Yagi-Uda antenna. A Yagi-Uda antenna is a type of directional antenna that consists of a driven element (usually a dipole) and one or more parasitic elements (usually a reflector and one or more directors) that enhance the radiation in a specific direction. Yagi-Uda antennas are widely used for radio communications, television reception, amateur radio, and radar systems.
The expected specifications and initial shape of the antenna are as follows:
• Frequency bandwidth: at least 500 MHz
• VSWR: less than 2:1
• Gain: at least 3 dBi
• Beamwidth: maximum 40 × 40
• Polarization: linear (vertical)
